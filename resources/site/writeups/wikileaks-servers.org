Patrick seems to be making the argument that Wikileaks is running on Russian servers, and that this indicates Russian influence over Wikileaks. I'll take a look at each of these points. 

* Summary

Analysis of DNS and ~whois~ data for ~wikileaks.org~ and subdomains reveals multiple servers hosted in Russia with a company called Hostkey. One of these servers lists contact data in Amsterdam, despite the server (and the company's headquarters) being located in Moscow. Hostkey's suspected and confirmed connections to FSB, the Russian hacker community, and Russian surveillance technology firms are concerning given that there is reason to suspect that Wikileaks' SSL connections are terminating in Moscow, thus providing the Russians with a cleartext copy of the private key.

* Wikileaks Server Identification

I'm going to track down individual server IP addresses using the ~dig~ command. The domains traced in the image are:

+ ~wikileaks.org~
+ ~ns1.wikileaks.org~
+ ~ns2.wikileaks.org~
+ ~ns3.wikileaks.org~
+ ~ns4.wikileaks.org~
+ ~mx.wikileaks.org~

Let's check each of these in turn.

* Host Nationality Influence?

So we can see from the above that a few different companies are involved in Wikileaks' hosting:

+ Solar Communications, GmbH
+ Blix Solutions
+ Hostkey
+ LeaseWeb

Interestingly, one of the Hostkey servers is falsely listed in Amsterdam, despite being actually located in Moscow (according to the MaxMind GeoIP database). 

** Blix Solutions

An ISP and server host based out of Oslo, Norway, Blix has data centers in Oslo, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and New York. Founded by Eirik Blix, it seems to be a young, flexible ISP/hosting business.

+ ~wikileaks.org~ :: 2 servers
+ ~ns3.wikileaks.org~ :: 1 server
+ ~ns4.wikileaks.org~ :: 1 server
+ ~mx.wikileaks.org~ :: 1 server

** Solar Communications, GmbH

A medium-sized host in Switzerland, Solar Communications offers dedicated servers, colocation, cloud hosting, a CDN, and DDOS protection. I've heard claims that they're a host for a number of private, corporate Tor nodes, but I haven't found any evidence of this yet. A [[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/GoodBadISPs#Switzerland][comment from them]] can be found on the Tor ISP review page on the Tor wiki, indicating that they'll allow relay nodes, but not exit nodes.

*** Servers

+ ~ns1.wikileaks.org~ / ~ns2.wikileaks.org~ :: 1 server (shared)

** LeaseWeb

LeaseWeb is a longstanding hosting provider offering dedicated, bare metal, and virtual servers, private cloud services, a CDN, and cybersecurity services. It's owned by Ocom, an internet services company led by Con Zwinkels, LeaseWeb's founder. LeaseWeb has encouraged partnership with Russia in the past. Rustelekom is a reseller of their services, and they do have Russian data centers. Wikileaks does not appear to be using any of their Russian servers, but it remains unclear how much influence, if any, Russia could have over LeaseWeb.

** Hostkey

Hostkey is a server, colocation and cloud hosting company based out of Moscow. They have an additional data center in Amsterdam, and listed one of the servers they rent to Wikileaks as being located there, despite GeoIP data indicating that the server is located in Moscow. Hostkey appears to be owned by Pyotr (or Petr or Peter) Chayanov, judging by whois data. As discussion broke about Chayanov on Twitter, he appears to have deleted all content on his twitter account. Chayanov is connected indirectly to Russian surveillance technology company MFI Soft through Alex Myodov, an MFI engineer who co-founded FreeBrie with him. See [[http://diago.sourceforge.net/cv_Myodov_Alexander_2009-01-20-en.pdf][Myodov's CV]], posted on an open source project of his.

A connection is argued to exist between Chayanov/Hostkey and Guccifer2, based on reports that the US State Voter database hacks were conducted from Hostkey-operated servers, as well as the fact that Wikileaks started using Hostkey's services approximately a week before releasing the DNC email hack. This evidence is circumstantial, but intriguing, and casts doubt on the trustworthiness of Chayanov and Hostkey.

* Distinguishing Possible Configurations

There are two main themes in the set of possible configurations that would look like this. Either:

1. The Hostkey server in Moscow /is/ doing SSL termination, and is providing redundancy and additional performance, or
2. The Moscow server /isn't/ doing SSL termination, and instead is passing requests on—at a minor performance cost—for the sake of obfuscation. 

There are no reliable ways to distinguish between these two possibilities. Minor hints might be extracted by comparing ping round trips to each server against SSL round trips, looking for differences in the ratios. This would not reveal much, however. All of the A records could be simple frontends that redirect to a different server which actually terminates the SSL connections. The possibility remains, however, that the Moscow server does terminate SSL connections. Given the inability to rule the possibility out, we must protect against it as though it's a reality. 

* Potential Impact

The company most likely to be of concern is Hostkey, due to links between it and both the Russian hacker community (through Hostkey's known hosting of malware sites) and the Russian surveillance community (through close colleague of Chayanov, Alex Myodov). Wikileaks hosts three servers with Hostkey: two nameservers and a web server.

The nameservers are a mild to moderate concern, due to their ability to direct Wikileaks' traffic (which is the primary function of a nameserver). Of greater concern is the web server. Given the real possibility that Hostkey has access to the SSL key, potential threats could range from passive fingerprinting to occasional injection of malware against particularly interesting visitors. This could further enable the potential deanonymization of leakers. 

* Conclusion

Given that there are reasons to doubt the trustworthiness of Hostkey and Chayanov, and given that the Hostkey-operated Wikileaks server may have cleartext access to the Wikileaks SSL cert, there are meaningful doubts to be had regarding the safety of accessing Wikileaks. It's worth noting that Assange has praised the Russian free press, arguing that Wikileaks isn't needed there. Wikileaks has not released any datasets targeting Russia at this time.
